# Contributing

Any Issues, Forks, or Pull Request with new features, improvements, or fixes are welcomed.

# Setup the project

* Clone the repository
* `$ cd align3d` and `$cargo build`

# Code guidelines

* Unit or integration tests should be able to run without any parameters, i.e., they use hardcoded resources from the repository.
* Tests that handle Vulkan Graphics should be marked with `[ignore]` so displayless CI can ignore them.
* Use `$ cargo clippy`.
